/**
 * Build identity for allmeta — used to stamp TruthCert receipts and JSON
 * exports with the exact code that produced them.
 *
 * Regenerate with: python scripts/regen_build_info.py
 *
 * Why this is signed: when receipts get audited months later, the reviewer
 * needs to know which code path produced the numbers. Without a SHA, you
 * can't replay a v11.0 calculation on a v11.4 codebase and expect a match —
 * estimator defaults drift, edge-case handling improves, prior conventions
 * change. The SHA pins the receipt to its provenance.
 *
 * Field meanings:
 *   - app:     always "allmeta" (constant)
 *   - version: semver-ish tag (matches CITATION.cff)
 *   - sha:     full git commit SHA at build time
 *   - shortSha: 7-char prefix for display
 *   - builtAt: ISO-8601 UTC timestamp when this file was regenerated
